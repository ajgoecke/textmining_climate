    <p>Why is the #FightFor1Point5 so essential and what are the practical steps we can take in order to make it happen? You can find out all this and more in the focus webinar in your timezone on the 11th of December!<lb/>Together with our headline speakers, activists from the frontlines of the climate crisis, and experts in organizing for political change, you will receive a 1.5 hour crash course on why and how to #FightFor1Point5. The webinar has two parts.</p>
    <quote><p>Part 1: ‘why we fight’ is about the basics of what 1.5 degrees Celsius means from a scientific standpoint, how it impacts people all over the world, and why this fight isn’t lost.</p><lb/>Part 2: ‘how we fight’ will teach us how to effectively continue to fight, organize, and campaign. We then end with Q&amp;A session where you get to ask any question about climate activism.</quote>
    <p>No matter what experience you have or don’t have, there will never be a better time to start fighting than right now! All you need is the will to make the change that we need right now!<lb/>The Webinars were live-streamed on Zoom and YouTube. Those in the zoom room were able to access translations in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German.</p>
