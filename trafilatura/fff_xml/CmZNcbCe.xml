    <p>or FFF, is a global climate strike movement that started in August 2018, when 15-year-old Greta Thunberg began a school strike for climate. In the three weeks leading up to the Swedish election, she sat outside Swedish Parliament every school day, demanding urgent action on the climate crisis. She was tired of society’s unwillingness to see the climate crisis for what it is: a crisis.</p>
    <p>To begin with, she was alone, but she was soon joined by others. On the 8th of September, Greta and her fellow school strikers decided to continue their strike until the Swedish policies provided a safe pathway well under 2° C, i.e. in line with the Paris agreement. They created the hashtag #FridaysForFuture, and encouraged other young people all over the world to join them. This marked the beginning of the global school strike for climate.</p>
    <p>Their call for action sparked an international awakening, with students and activists uniting around the globe to protest outside their local parliaments and city halls. Along with other groups across the world, Fridays for Future is part of a hopeful new wave of change, inspiring millions of people to take action on the climate crisis, and we want you to become one of us!</p>
    <head rend="h2">Our Goals</head>
    <p>The goal of the movement is to put moral pressure on policymakers, to make them listen to the scientists, and then to take forceful action to limit global warming.</p>
    <p>Our movement is independent of commercial interests and political parties and knows no borders.</p>
    <p>We strike because we care for our planet and for each other. We have hope that humanity can change, avert the worst climate disasters and build a better future.</p>
    <p>Every day there are more of us and together we are strong. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is needed. No one is too small to make a difference.</p>
