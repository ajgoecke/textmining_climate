    <head rend="h4">Fridays for Future fights against Standard Chartered Bank‚Äôs abuse of environmental and human rights by providing finance to fossil fuel expansion. As a movement, FFF rises up to stop SCB from financing fossil fuel companies immediately.</head>
    <head rend="h2">What is this about?</head>
    <p>Divestment Campaigns:</p>
    <p>A key driver of the climate crisis is the global financial system which continues to invest, lend and direct capital flows to new fossil fuel exploration and infrastructure. As 1.2¬∞C of global warming is already the hell for most countries, it is time to end this dirty business. Fridays for Future make sure of that.</p>
    <head rend="h2">Who is SCB?</head>
    <p>Standard Chartered is the UK‚Äôs coal bank, a climate killer. This bank is investing billions in fossil fuel companies all over the world. In total, with their dirty business they have channelled $24 billion into coal, oil and gas companies already since the Paris Agreement.</p>
    <head rend="h2">Why SCB?</head>
    <p>The SCB is one of the world‚Äôs largest coal financers, with significant fossil financing particularly in MAPA and regarded as a critical first-mover on the global financial market. With COP26 being in the UK this year and SCB being headquartered in the UK, this is a perfect opportunity to remind them to raise their standards. With $8.5 billion this bank is one of the largest financiers of coal expansionists since the Paris Agreement. Mainly, the investment goes into coal plants, mines, and infrastructures developers in Asia and Africa, like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
    <p>Some of the companies that SCB finances and are active in Indonesia are PLN Persero, Indonesia Asahan Aluminium , Adaro Energy. In the Philippines they finance other companies like Top Frontier Investment Holdings, Aboitiz Equity Ventures and Marubeni Corporation. They even finance a company active in Argentina called AES. The world‚Äôs most aggressive coal plants expansionists. They also finance the coal mining companies Glencore and Anglo American.</p>
    <p>The companies are headquartered in Switzerland and the UK, however their business lies mainly in South Africa, Colombia and Australia. SCB also finances the Canadian company First Quantum Minerals which is currently constructing a coal power plant in Botswana. Despite almost half of the population not having access to reliable electricity, the power would be exported to South Africa. In South Africa, they finance Eskom which is operating incredibly dirty coal plants and still has massive expansion plans.</p>
