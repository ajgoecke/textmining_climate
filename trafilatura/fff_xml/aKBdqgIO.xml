    <p>A year ago, the world’s most powerful people gathered in Davos. The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting was, as always, about business and politics, but climate was given more importance than ever before. The consequences of this were hard to see – action should have followed but far too little happened this year.</p>
    <p>It was not an easy year, in many ways a foretaste of things to come. It was one of the hottest years on record and its disasters destroyed and took the homes and lives of hundreds of thousands. To make it through this unusual year, it was necessary to show global solidarity. However, this cannot stop with the pandemic. Especially in order to slow down human-caused global warming, this solidarity is absolutely crucial. Only if we all pull together, all pursue the same goal, all stand up for a future worth living, we can make a difference.</p>
    <p>With the publication of the Davos Agenda 2021, the WEF aims to deliver solutions to 7 key areas – climate change being one of them. As a key player in international cooperation, the WEF and its members have an enormous responsibility towards the entire world population.</p>
    <p>The global players can no longer hide behind empty words and greenwashed solutions. They must act according to their responsibilities and know that the world is watching each and every of their moves.</p>
    <p>On Friday the 29th of January we will make the WEF and it’s members aware of their responsibility. With the hashtag #TheWorldIsWatching, we show that they must act accordingly and that the time for excuses is over.</p>
    <p>At 10am UTC, a tweetstorm will take place under #TheWorldIsWatching.</p>
    <p>We are also calling for a Digital Strike. Make a sign, take a picture with it and post it on social media with the hashtag #TheWorldIsWatching. If the situation in your country allows it, we emphasise having a physical strike.</p>
    <p>Power to the People – see you on Friday!</p>
