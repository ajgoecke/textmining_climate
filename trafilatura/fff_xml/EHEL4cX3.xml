    <p>FFF groups around the world have staged a long-planned global climate demonstration online on the April 24th, because of restrictions on public protests during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Some groups have found very creative ways to stage demonstrations despite the lockdown. In Berlin, activists placed thousands of protest placards in front of the German parliament.</p>
    <p>With 87,000 on the strikersâ€™ map, over 230,000 livestream viewers, 40,000 tweets and 15,000 demo signs, we made it clear: We are to be reckoned with and we want the course to be set for a just, ecological society!</p>
