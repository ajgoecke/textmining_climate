    <p>You can still join the tweetstorm on Thursday December 10th! We targeted mostly national governments to #FightFor1Point5! Some tweets tagged governments to stop funding their national oil companies, some tagged local politicians to take climate action, and more 😉</p>
    <p>The sample tweets are here.</p>

      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>The 5th anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement is on the 12th of December. Yet the UN and our governments have done little to limit global temperature increases.</p>
      <p>We cannot wait for some distant future – for many countries the crisis is already here.</p>
