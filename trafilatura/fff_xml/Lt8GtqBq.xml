    <p>Every Friday – due to the CoronaCrisis – we strike online, giving a voice to those unable to strike.</p>
    <p>Digital Strike is a social media movement to engage individuals who aren’t able to skip school every Friday to climate strike and allow them to still express their solidarity with the Fridays for Future movement.</p>
    <p>FFF Digital provides a way for those who cannot physically strike to raise their voice on the Internet, making the movement more accessible to those in the Global South, during outbreaks like COVID-19, etc.</p>
