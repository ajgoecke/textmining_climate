    <p>Since many interested people had not booked or canceled their trip to our conference in Munich because of the uncertain situation, we organized a professional live stream. You can access the talks of our speakers at YouTube tomorrow; the link will be created and published on this site. It starts on Friday at 10 A.M. local time (GMT +1) with the welcome by EIKE President Dr. Holger Thuss.</p>
    <p>The complete program can be viewed here.</p>
