Donations
We have no founding or extra support. Still, we need support for room-rental, coffee/tea breaks twice a day and other running expenses.
We therefore call for voluntary donations.
The Secretary General (morner@pog.nu] has an account prepared for this. PayPal to his e-mail works well. Directly at the conference is another easy option (but, please, tell me of your intentions so that I know how to manage our budget).
