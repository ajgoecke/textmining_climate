Dear friend,
We hereby invite you to our international climate and energy conference in München. From the 22nd – 23rd November researchers and experts will present and discuss lesser-known scientific and political aspects of climate and energy.
Even if different events are currently dominating the headlines, the theme of „climate protection“ and thus the „Energiewende“ seem to be immortal. Because, despite the enormous costs of the energy supply and its questionable benefits, the policy, supported by almost all established media, maintains this.
If you are unable to attend the conference yourself, we would be pleased if you forward the invitation to interested parties.
We are looking forward to welcoming you in Munich
Dr. Holger Thuss
