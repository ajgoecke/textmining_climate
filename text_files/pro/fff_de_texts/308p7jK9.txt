Our four #voteclimate CLIMATEELECTION spots are available for download as DCP-format.
There also is a German language version available for each clip.
All spots are FSK approved by the age of 0 and may be shown on every day of the year (in Germany).
Support us raising the voter turnout and show as many of our clips as possible. Because:
Everyone has a choice, but not everyone has a vote!
