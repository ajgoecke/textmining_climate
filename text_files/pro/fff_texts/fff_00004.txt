There are many impressive and engaged climate strikers. The fastest way to get in touch is to email a country or countries directly here.
If you are looking for several climate activists, please consider including different parts of the world. There are climate activists on every continent, including the Antarctica, and in almost every country in the world.
If the country you are looking for is not on the list, or if the country does not respond, please try contacting local strikers (see Map Of Actions for how to do that), or contact another country, or email us, email address below the list of countries, and we will try to help.
For Greta Thunberg participation or interview, please use this email. Should Greta be unable to participate, other climate activists can be reached by emailing FFF countries.
