FFF groups around the world have staged a long-planned global climate demonstration online on the April 24th, because of restrictions on public protests during the coronavirus pandemic.
Some groups have found very creative ways to stage demonstrations despite the lockdown. In Berlin, activists placed thousands of protest placards in front of the German parliament.
With 87,000 on the strikersâ€™ map, over 230,000 livestream viewers, 40,000 tweets and 15,000 demo signs, we made it clear: We are to be reckoned with and we want the course to be set for a just, ecological society!
