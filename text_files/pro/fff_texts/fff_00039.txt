Tune into to the International 24 hour Fridays for Future earthweek livestream to hear from strikers and scientists from around the world! April 24th, 2020
Tune in to our youtube channel at any time on the 24th of April, Fridays For Future will be holding a 24 hour livestream on our International YouTube channel.
This will be a day of global unity, where Fridays For Future groups in as many different countries as possible will get to share their experiences, how the climate crisis has impacted their communities and what change they want to see.
The 24th of April was supposed to be a global strike. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has put the world on hold, and we must adapt.
We strongly believe in uniting behind science and understanding the emergency, therefore we made the decision to engage on this crisis in a different way without putting our communities at risk.
