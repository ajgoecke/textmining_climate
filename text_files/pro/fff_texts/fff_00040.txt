You can still join the tweetstorm on Thursday December 10th! We targeted mostly national governments to #FightFor1Point5! Some tweets tagged governments to stop funding their national oil companies, some tagged local politicians to take climate action, and more 😉
The sample tweets are here.

Hello,
The 5th anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement is on the 12th of December. Yet the UN and our governments have done little to limit global temperature increases.
We cannot wait for some distant future – for many countries the crisis is already here.

Thanks!
