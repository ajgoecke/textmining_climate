Project Information
The electrification of motorized private transport plays an important role in the design of an environmentally friendly and climate-friendly transport system. The Berlin Senate Administration for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection launched the first charging infrastructure in the framework of the so-called Berlin model in April 2015, and has continuously continued to develop the offer. Currently, there are about 170 AC charging stations (340 charging points) as well as six quick charging station (DC) and several light poles equipped with charging technology.
The previous time-based tariff structure of the Berlin model was temporarily converted into a flat rate (“session fee”) determined by the loading technique used by the customer. This large-scale experiment allows for a comparative analysis of both billing regimes, especially with regard to user behavior.
On behalf of the Senate Administration, IKEM conducts extensive investigations into the demand effects of the different charging tariffs. Possible changes in the behavior of the users will be analyzed. In this context, the frequency of charging infrastructure uses as well as the duration of the connection and the amount of electricity delivered are of particular importance. Possible changes regarding the user groups as well as misuse of parking places are further aspects of the investigation. In addition, the IKEM also takes into account the customer’s view of the tariff change.
Within the framework of the research project, the State of Berlin is equipping selected loading infrastructure sites with detection technology. The data will constitute an integral part of the analysis of the parking space misuse at charging stations.
