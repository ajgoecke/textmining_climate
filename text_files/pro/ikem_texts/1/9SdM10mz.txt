Kick-Off Conference „Baltic InteGrid“
IKEM hosted the official kick-off conference of the EU-funded Baltic InteGrid project on the 22nd of March in Berlin.
As the Lead of a 14-partner strong consortium (pictured), IKEM welcomed representatives of governments, TSOs, offshore wind industry and utility providers as well as legal, spatial planning and environmental experts from around the Baltic Sea region for the event.
The conference was the first in a series of expert events organized in the framework of the Baltic InteGrid, taking place across the region over the next four years.
During this time, the Baltic InteGrid will analyse the necessary framework conditions for an optimal development of regional offshore wind resources by applying the meshed grid approach. Rooted in the region’s common resource, the Baltic Sea, a meshed offshore grid would be a showcase project responding to the need for cost-efficient sustainable energy development, regional electricity market integration and security of supply, and reinforcing the region’s identity of green development and innovation.
The Baltic InteGrid’s research spectrum covers the region-wide state, outlook and recommended actions in the fields of:
1. Policy & regulation
2. Market & supply
3. Technology & grid
4. Environment & society
5. Spatial planning
6. Cost-benefit analysis
With the recent commencement of the Danish and German electricity grid connection through Kriegers Flak, an integrated region-wide offshore grid has moved from concept to reality.
IKEM looks forward to contributing to this progress with the Baltic InteGrid for the coming years.
