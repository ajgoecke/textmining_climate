Biography
Alexander Voigt is a physicist and both a solar and energy storage pioneer. As founder, CEO and supervisory board member of a number of national and international companies, he has been working on a competitive CO2-free energy supply for 30 years. In 2015 he founded Lumenion GmbH, of which he is still the managing director today. Lumenion develops and builds thermal high-temperature storage systems (and, if desired, associated steam power plants) that can be used to store large amounts of renewable energy reliably and cost-effectively. These sector-coupled storage systems offer great opportunities in the decarbonization of industry and the heating market. The foundation of Lumenion is the result of his many years of experience.
From 2012 to 2019 Alexander Voigt was a member of the supervisory board of Greenpeace. Since 2020 he is a member of the advisory board of IKEM.
But we simply can no longer afford this luxury. Both the climate and technology are changing far too quickly for us to allow ourselves to lag behind forever.
That’s why I consider institutions like IKEM to be particularly important – and with my commitment I would like to bring together the outstanding legal and regulatory know-how with the latest technology and market developments.
