Biogas and biomethane are considered carbon neutral competitors to fossil natural gas and therefore an essential part of the energy transition (“Energiewende”). In biogas facilities, waste products, plants and energy-crops are fermented to gas. The final product can be used directly as fuel for vehicles or to generate electricity. Alternatively, biogas can be fed into the natural gas grid after reprocessing.
Together with Fraunhofer IWES, IKEM has examined concepts for a controllable and demand-driven electricity generation from biogas and biomethane. The development of feasible biomethane and biogas energy products is based on technical possibilities, environmental and economic impacts, the potentials of the two fuels and the legal framework plays an important role. Therefore, the IKEM analyzed in this project, the existing legal framework and developed proposals for further development of the regulatory framework with a view to the best possible integration of these energy sources into the energy system.
