IKEM develops new approaches to energy system transformation and makes results accessible to a wide audience. We increase visibility and acceptance for sustainable solutions, extending the reach of scientific research and maximising its impact.
The Sustainability & Innovation team specialises in the creation of targeted communication strategies that facilitate interdisciplinary exchange among a broad range of stakeholders.
The energy transition can’t succeed without everyone on board. It’s not enough to gain acceptance – we need to build excitement!
The energy transition must be driven forward in every sector – and by the public at large. We can promote public participation in climate-change projects by encouraging early and extensive engagement. IKEM mobilises support for sustainable solutions through social innovation research and innovative communication techniques.
For an effective response to climate challenges, it’s essential for everyone to have information on the latest climate and energy developments. But technical terms and cryptic abbreviations often prevent people outside climate- and energy-related fields from accessing this vital information. At IKEM, the Sustainability & Innovation team specialises in the creation of tangible communication tools that convey complex concepts in user-friendly formats, like the multi-award-winning Infographic Energy Transition Coloring Book. Our work provides the basis for informed decision-making and generates public enthusiasm for the many opportunities that can emerge from smart responses to climate change.
To succeed, the energy transition must take place on a global scale. That’s why IKEM promotes international knowledge sharing: the Sustainability & Innovation team connects experts, practitioners, and students through interdisciplinary conferences, training courses, and workshops. This includes the world-renowned IKEM Academy, which, since 2004, has brought together leading energy transition experts from around the world. In addition, IKEM has spearheaded numerous research collaborations and gained extensive project management experience through its work with European and international partners.
