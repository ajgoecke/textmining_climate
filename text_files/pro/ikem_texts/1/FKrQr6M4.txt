Offshore Wind in the Baltic Sea: Legal and Policy Perspectives on a Regional Meshed Grid
On 25 November 2016, IKEM hosted the partnership and stakeholders of the Baltic InteGrid in Berlin to further the discussions on policy and regulatory obstacles towards a meshed offshore grid in the Baltic Sea.
The conference
The Baltic InteGrid examines the road towards a meshed offshore grid from six disciplinary perspectives, one being the research field: Policy and Regulation. In this light, IKEM hosts an international conference entitled ‘Offshore Wind in the Baltic Sea: Legal and Policy Perspectives on a Regional Meshed Grid’, for policy-makers, legal experts, regulatory researchers and practitioners from around the Baltic Sea to exchange ideas and build our network.
The program looks at the policy and regulatory challenges surrounding offshore wind development, interconnectors and of course, a meshed grid. The conference offers different perspectives, featuring representatives from the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR), the legal and industry sector, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, transmission system operators, as well as the H2020 project ‘PROMOTion’, which focuses on meshed offshore grids in the North Sea. The program also features a ‘Lighting Round’ during which experts of the Baltic InteGrid give brief insights into the state of offshore wind and the relevance of interconnectors to their national markets.
