Transnational exchange in the MAMBA project
In the Interreg project MAMBA, we are working with our partners from the Baltic Sea region on innovative concepts to promote rural mobility. At two events in Latvia, project results – including a legal analysis by IKEM – were presented and discussed.
During the fourth transnational partner meeting in Cēsis, the results of the scientific studies on rural mobility from an economic, socio-cultural and legal perspective were presented. IKEM expert Maximilian Ellner outlined the most important aspects of the legal research he conducted. The studies provide preparation for the pilot projects on a theoretical level and should help to avoid problems in the implementation phase. For this purpose, there will be a regular exchange between the participating research institutes and the practical project partners.
The subsequent Rural Mobility Seminar in Riga was open to the interested public. Under the title “Innovative Rural Mobility” the MAMBA consortium presented its project work and discussed opportunities and obstacles for innovative mobility solutions with participants from the Baltic Sea region and other European countries. Maximilian Ellner discussed the results of the legal study conducted as part of the MAMBA project in a panel discussion with the MAMBA project partners, external experts and the audience.
