Project information
Together with BBHC, IKEM is preparing a general study on electric mobility in the Rostock overseas port for Rostock Port GmbH. The study shows the current situation of electromobility as well as the potential for building and operating charging infrastructure, including possible operator and billing models for port operations.
Market analyses for different vehicle segments and application areas in Germany and several Scandinavian countries will be carried out. Furthermore, the study also includes the design of practical test scenarios for special electric vehicles in port operations as well as the evaluation of various possible charging infrastructure types and operator models in the port.
The study for Rostock Port GmbH is part of the Interreg project “Creating Automotive Renewal” (CAR).
IKEM’s role in the project
One focus of IKEM’s work is the analysis of market developments, scenarios for market introduction and political objectives. The aim is to determine the feasability of charging infrastructure at the port. To this end, the evaluation of databases and market studies is combined with the analysis of European and non-European reference projects. IKEM prepares overviews of e-vehicle and charging infrastructure models in order to select suitable models for the creation of test scenarios. In addition, IKEM evaluates scenarios for different models of charging infrastructure operation as well as for further potential development paths, such as the construction of LNG or hydrogen filling stations for gas or fuel cell drives.
