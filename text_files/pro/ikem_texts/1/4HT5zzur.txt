On 25 November 2016, IKEM will host Baltic InteGrid project partners and stakeholders in Berlin to discuss policy and regulatory obstacles towards a meshed offshore grid in the Baltic Sea.
The conference
The Baltic InteGrid explores pathways towards a meshed offshore grid in the context of six disciplines, including the field of policy and regulation. ‘Offshore Wind in the Baltic Sea: Legal and Policy Perspectives on a Regional Meshed Grid’ is an international conference that provides a platform for policy-makers, legal experts, regulatory researchers, and practitioners from around the Baltic Sea to exchange ideas and build networks.
The experts
The programme examines policy and regulatory challenges surrounding offshore wind development, interconnectors, and a meshed grid. The conference explores these issues from different perspectives and features legal experts, industry stakeholders, transmission system operators, and representatives from the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, and the H2020 project ‘PROMOTion’, which focuses on meshed offshore grids in the North Sea. The programme also includes a ‘lighting round’, during which experts from the Baltic InteGrid project will offer brief insights into the state of offshore wind and the relevance of interconnectors to their national markets.
