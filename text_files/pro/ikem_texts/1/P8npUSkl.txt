Background
Content
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are the Contracting Members of the Energy Community Treaty which aims to extend the EU internal energy market to South East Europe and beyond on the basis of a legally binding framework. Turkey is an observer to the Treaty. Under the Treaty, its contracting members are obliged to introduce EU energy efficiency legislation, among other obligations. Achieving these targets required by this legislation requires more ambitious policy efforts and larger investments into the demand-side energy efficiency, than they are at present.
Among its priority topic areas, IKEM has been involved into research and capacity building related to low-carbon transformation of the Western Balkans.
In particular, IKEM prepared a country-wide analysis of costs and benefits associated with thermal efficiency retrofits of the public buildings in Albania. The analysis attempted to make a first go to identify and monetize additional benefits of thermal efficiency improvement to saved energy costs, e.g. thermal comfort, avoided CO2 emissions, avoided economic effects from airborne pollutants, employment, and economic growth. Finally, IKEM prepared a tool for policy-makers, which may be used to simulate a set of thermal energy retrofit packages applied to different building types and calculate the budget requite.

Presentation at COP21
The 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP21, gave the opportunity to present the SLED project as well as an ongoing programme ECRAN at the side event “Climate Cooperation between the EU, the Western Balkans and Turkey”, on December the 5th, 2015. The overriding goal was to shed more light on ECRAN´s activities regarding convergence with EU climate policies and legislation; assistance with the development and implementation of INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions); capacity building for the implementation of the EU ETS (Emissions Trading System); compliance with the EU’s monitoring mechanism (GHG inventories), and adaptation actions.

The objective of the training program was to increase technical capacities in the countries to use quantitative models and scenario development for the assessment of climate and energy targets, and policy options. The beneficiaries of the training were the Ministries of Environment in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.
The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) was used as a modeling tool.
