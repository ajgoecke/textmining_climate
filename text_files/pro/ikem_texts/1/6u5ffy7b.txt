The expanded use of renewable energies demands great efforts regarding grid regulation and development. The technology Power to Gas can be used for long-term storage of electricity by converting overcapacities into hydrogen through electrolysis. Unlike pumped storage power plants, material storage is more flexible in its subsequent use because the generated gas can either be stored in tanks on site or fed into the gas grid. Additionally, the existing natural gas infrastructure already offers big storage capacities that can be made use of through Power to Gas.
Even though the necessary infrastructure and transport capacity are available and the technical procedures are almost ready for the market, issues regarding the legal and policy framework need to be clarified. This serves to ensure investment security for storage infrastructure in the context of further expansion of renewables. Therefore, IKEM addresses these issues in various projects. Relying on economic and legal analysis, IKEM proposes ideas and starting points for policy change in order to remove barriers and create conditions for an efficient promotion of energy storages in general and of Power to Gas facilities in particular.
