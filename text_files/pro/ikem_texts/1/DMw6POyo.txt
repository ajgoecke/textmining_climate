The "Netz-Stabil" research network is investigating how a stable and reliable energy supply can be achieved despite fluctuating generation.
By implementing low-carbon solutions, the project aims to contribute to the efficiency and sustainability of transport in the South Baltic Region.
The project focusses on reduction of CO2-emissions and enhancement of energy efficiency in public lighting. In cooperation with the University of Greifswald, IKEM will develop financing models and clarify of the legal framework for dynamic lighting.
