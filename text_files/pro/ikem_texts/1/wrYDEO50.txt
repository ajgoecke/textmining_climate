Die Ostseeregion birgt eigentlich ein enormes Entwicklungspotenzial für Offshore-Windenergie, jedoch befinden sich dort nur rund 15% der Offshore-Windparks in der EU während der Großteil der Windanlagen in der Nordsee entstanden ist. Studien haben gezeigt, dass die internationale Koordination in Bezug auf Offshore-Netzinfrastruktur sowie deren transantionale Netzintegration (sog. “Offshore Meshed Grid”) erhebliche finanzielle Einsparungen ermöglicht. Vor diesem Hintergrund kann der relativ geringe Entwicklungsstand in der Ostsee ein Wettbewerbsvorteil sein, da die Erkenntnisse aus der Nordsee genutzt werden können, um die Gestaltung des Offshore-Netzes der Region zu optimieren.
Derzeit gibt es keine umfassende intersektionale Studie über die Offshore-Netzplanung und -integration im Ostseeraum obwohl die Stärkung der internationalen Koordinierung und der Bau von Verbindungsleitungen zwischen den nationalen Energiemärkten von EU, BASREC und nationalen Regierungen als wichtig eingestuft wird.
Projektinformationen
Baltic InteGrid möchte diese Lücke füllen und den “Offshore Meshed Grid”-Ansatz in der Ostseeregion anwenden. Zu diesem Zweck arbeitet das IKEM mit Projektpartnern aus allen acht EU-Mitgliedstaaten der Ostseeregion sowie relevanten Interessensgruppen (Übertragungsnetzbetreiber (ÜNB), OWE-Industrie, Politik, nationale Behörden, Hochschulen) zusammen. Alle Beteiligten werden durch das Projekt besser vernetzt und erhalten die Möglichkeit zum Wissensaustausch. Die begleitenden Forschungsanstregungen versorgen die Akteure mit Wissen zur optimalen Gestaltung eines integrierten Offshore-Stromnetzes in der Region.
Baltic Grid Forum
Das Baltic Grid Forum ist eine Plattform zur Einbeziehung aller Interessensgruppen. Durch nationale Workshops, branchenspezifische Konferenzen und öffentliche Veranstaltungen lässt das Forum ein regionales Expertennetzwerk für Offshore-Windnetzausbau entstehen und stellt die praktische Relevanz und Anwendbarkeit der Forschungsschwerpunkte und -ergebnisse des Projekts sicher.
Baltic Grid Concept
Das Baltic Grid Concept wird die Rahmenbedingungen für die erfolgreiche Entwicklung einer integrierten Offshore-Windinfrastruktur in der Ostsee durch internationale interdisziplinäre Forschung bestimmen. Das Konzept wird bei den weiteren Schritten als Bezugs- und Anknüpfungspunkt für die regionalen Akteure dienen.
Machbarkeitsstudien
Zwei vertiefende Vorab-Machbarkeitsstudien sollen durchgeführt werden: Erstens Polen und Schweden (mit der Möglichkeit Litauen und Deutschland einzubeziehen) sowie, zweitens, Deutschland und Dänemark. Die Studien untersuchen das Konzept eines “Netzrings” im südlichen Ostseeraum, d.h. den Bau zusätzlicher On- und Offshore-Verbindungen zwischen diesen Staaten.
Alle acht EU-Mitgliedstaaten der Ostseeregion sind im Projekt Baltic InteGrid vertreten. Der Komplexität und Interdisziplinarität des Themas wird mit einem Konsortium von insgesamt vierzehn Partnern aus den Bereichen Politik, Regulierung, maritime Raumplanung, Netzinfrastruktur und -technologie, Zivilgesellschaft, Wirtschaft und Industrie Rechnung getragen. Durch den großen Kreis der assoziierten Partner werden Industrie, Ministerien, Energieversorger und Übertragungsnetzbetreiber in den Forschungs- und Wissensgewinnungsprozess des Projekts integriert.

abstract = {Governments across the globe are finally recognising the urgent need to jointly address climate change. This has led to the commitments under the Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming well below 2 °C. While the global energy transition is gaining momentum, there is far too little progress to stay within the 2 °C target. To accelerate the shift to a sustainable energy system, we need innovative ideas that go beyond business as usual.
Europe has been a leader in climate policy in general, and in the development of renewable energy in particular – although other countries are quickly catching up. The European Union has set out to foster renewable energy development and further market interconnection, reducing emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 in the process.
Offshore wind energy is crucial to this renewable energy future. Boasting a higher generation capacity and more full load hours than onshore wind, the sector has achieved remarkable cost reductions in recent years. The Baltic Sea has great potential in this regard, thanks to a range of favourable conditions like shallow waters, strong winds and short distances to shore.
With 2.2 GW of installed capacity and rising, the offshore wind market in the Baltic Sea is on the cusp of accelerated development. Now is the time to explore state-of-the-art solutions for the connection and distribution of offshore wind energy. A meshed grid is one such solution: an innovative, efficient way to link offshore wind farms while connecting electricity markets. Combining interconnector infrastructure with export cables, a meshed offshore grid in the Baltic Sea would boost system stability and the integration of electricity markets, reduce issues linked to curtailment and ensure a high utilisation rate for cable infrastructure. Moreover, the installation, maintenance and service sector that would be developed around a meshed offshore grid could help the Baltic Sea Region excel in green technologies and innovation while creating jobs for local populations.
While a meshed offshore grid has many benefits, it is also characterised by a multilateral and capital-intensive nature, the complexity of which needs to be alleviated through a guiding hand from policy-makers. Keeping in mind the long lead times of offshore wind and grid projects, it is imperative that interest in meshed offshore grids translate into bold policy-making and reinforced transnational cooperation soon, before the region is further locked into a suboptimal energy system.
