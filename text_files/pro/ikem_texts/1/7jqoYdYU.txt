Roadmap to Automated Electric Shuttles in Public Transport
Sohjoa Baltic is a transnational project addressing driverless vehicles in public transport. Since 2017, IKEM and its partners have examined the legal, economical, administrative and technological requirements for the use of automated vehicles in the Baltic Sea region. The results will be published in a five-volume roadmap.
The upcoming years are crucial to the development of automated driving in Europe. The technology has great potential to serve the public interest by improving the environmental sustainability of traffic and making transit safer and more enjoyable for everyone. At the same time, there is a risk that everyone will use his or her own private automated car, increasing the number of motorised vehicles on the road. Automated vehicles as part of public transport is a goal worth aiming for. Therefore, the Sohjoa Baltic project researched, promoted, and piloted the use of driverless, electric minibuses in public transport to secure the benefits of automated driving for society as a whole.
The project’s findings will be published in the Roadmap to Automated Electric Shuttles in Public Transport which consists of the following five volumes:
