Project Information
IKEM, supported by the energy law firm Becker Büttner Held and commissioned by naturwind schwerin GmbH, has prepared a study on decentralised energy supply for Lübesse.
The study is based on a project by naturwind schwerin GmbH, which aims to implement a decentralised energy supply in the bioenergy village of Lübesse. The project aims to use electricity from existing and new wind turbines, solar and biomass plants as directly as possible for an emission-free, decentralised energy supply and the production of renewable raw materials. The project is currently in the planning or concept phase.
The legal feasibility study shows the essential legal framework conditions for a legally permissible and economically feasible concept of electricity and heat supply in the bioenergy village of Lübesse.
The study is addressed the description of (electricity) grid types and grid regulation and presents the rights and obligations associated with the operation of grid infrastructure (electricity, heat) owned by the operator. Among other things, the regulatory framework for power generation plants, the power supply paths of the various consumers in the “decentralised energy supply system” and the associated government-induced costs at the expense of the end consumer are considered. The study presents the regulatory framework conditions for an emission-free, decentralised heat supply in Lübesse.
The feasibility study is intended to create a suitable basis for the elaboration and provision of sample contracts that can be used in the implementation phase of the project.
