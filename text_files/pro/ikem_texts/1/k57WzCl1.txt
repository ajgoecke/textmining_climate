IKEM Academy 2020 (14.-16. Juli 2020)
IKEM’s flagship international Academy: Energy and Climate took place digitally this year! The DigiAcademy’s program was built around the topic: ‘Climate countdown: Ramping up the energy transition to meet our targets’. As the world’s carbon budget to stay below 1,5 degrees will be depleted in 8 years, it is time to speed things up!
Over 100 participants from 22 different nationalities registered to learn and exchange on the state of climate policy, and the social, technical and financial innovations and solutions there are to accelerate the decarbonization of our energy systems and stay below 1,5 °C. From climate change to sector integration, from peer-to peer trading to climate finance and offshore wind, the program was packed with inspiring ideas and topics, and further enriched by the discussions rounds, polls and interactive sessions with the international participants.
The DigiAcademy was a great success, and the Sustainability and Innovation team is looking forward to hosting next year’s Academy, hopefully in person!
