Background
Another innovative collaboration between IKEM and Berlin-based Ellery Studio for Creative Strategies, the Gender Equality Toolkit – EQT – is a fun, playful assortment of tools that includes a card game, a booklet and a poster – all with beautiful and illuminating illustrations. It raises awareness about gender inequality and empowers people to take action against sexism in professional environments.
This is a self-funded project that was born out of the shared experiences of our colleagues and a desire to address gender inequality in an informative and engaging way with facts, arguments and statistics. The goal is to empower women and allies to speak up against sexism and raise awareness of challenges and opportunities for improvement. The toolkit keeps a positive and light tone and aims to draw a wide range of people into the conversation about equality.

Infographic Booklet
An informative infographic booklet of myth-busting, argument-building and empowering information from which anyone entering conversations on equality could benefit.
Card game
The card game starts with 50 cards that illustrate a range of ways in which sexism can manifest at work. A corresponding set of 50 response cards suggest possible reactions. The game allows players to learn about structural challenges in an engaging, even fun, way thanks to the comic-style visuals and colourful design.
Poster
The beautiful poster shows inspiring women and female empowerment throughout history visualised in waves from the suffragettes onwards.
Team
A cross-section of people from both IKEM and Ellery Studio worked on this project, often building on incidents from their own lives and careers. From illustrations to narratives, EQT therefore comprises a rich range of different lived experiences and types of creativity.
