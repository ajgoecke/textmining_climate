Both the very low market share of electric cars and the medium/short-term cost assessments regarding electric mobilityâ€™s implementation show that the automotive industry still lacks viable business for this technology.
In contrast, environmental and transport politics highlight the numerous benefits of electric mobility and even states economic interests as a factor that justifies a more profound political support for government-funded market incentives. Because, in comparison with regular cars, electric cars have different performance characteristics, fields of application and functionalities, they are associated with changed value creation architectures. They also pose risks for old and opportunities for new business models.
Together with Siemens AG, IKEM analyzed new business models of electric mobility. The central research questions concern the current incoherence of technical opportunities, legal frameworks, demand for electric vehicles, infrastructure requirements and business models. The investigation therefore focusses on innovative business models in the areas of mobility services, energy and transport infrastructure. The project was interdisciplinary: the project team combined economic expertise with legal and social sciences. The technical foundations of electric mobility were analyzed in close cooperation with the project partners from Siemens Mobility.
