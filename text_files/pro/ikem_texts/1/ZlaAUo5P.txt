WindNODE wants to promote efficient integration of renewable energy generation, electricity grids and energy users, based on digital interconnection. WindNODE is the showcase in which the German capital region and Northeastern Germany present the technological progress achieved through the energy transition to national and international audiences. Innovative and customer-driven products will be tested in a large-scale real-life laboratory.
IKEM is part of the WindNODE consortium funded by the SINTEG program of the Federal Ministry of Economy and Energy (BMWi).
The aim of IKEM’s sub project is to identify approaches for an optimized legal framework for innovative renewable energy technologies. It should take into account newly developed economic models, necessary changes in market mechanisms as well as exhibitors’ technical innovations. Therefore, IKEM will undertake an analysis of existing legal barriers.
This analysis will include the European regulatory, unbundling and state aid requirements. It will also check the transferability of the approaches to other regions and pursue an approach aimed at the harmonization of law. To ensure from the outset that the energy industry’s regulatory framework as well as requirements for consumer and data protection are taken into account while developing the WindNODE blueprint for the energy system of the future, IKEM will continuously address specific legal issues from a scientific perspective.
