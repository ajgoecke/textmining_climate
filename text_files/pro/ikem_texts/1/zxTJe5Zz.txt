The Horizon 2020 project MEISTER aims to improve the conditions for the use of electromobility and the energy supply of vehicles.
The availability and easy use of charging infrastructure is an crucial part of electromobility. In the research project ANS, IKEM examines the use of charging stations in Berlin and the impact of a tariff conversion from time-based prices to flat rates.
in cooperation with the Center for Rural Mobility at the University of Wismar, IKEM developed solutions for the revitalization of public transport in rural areas.
The spread of electric mobility offers numerous economic and environmental opportunities. In order to achieve this, viable economic concepts are needed.
Together with the Fraunhofer Institute IWES, IKEM has prepared a study on the sustainable development of e-mobility for the Federal Environment Ministry.
The IKEM provides legal accompanying research for the project "Electromobility for trucks - better environmental protection for agglomerations"
Expansion of urban electric mobility by improving infrastructure and introducing innovative practical concepts.
With combined DC-AC fast charging stations, electric mobility can also succeed in long-distance transportation.
Sustainable urban mobility through electric mobility, intermodality and intelligent parking.
