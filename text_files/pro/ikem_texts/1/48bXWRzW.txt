Energy Law and its ramifications are crucial for the success of the energy transition (Energiewende), as they can provide both incentives or obstacles to the expansion of renewable energies. Together with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ), IKEM works as lead partner on a project that aims to outline the development of a sustainable energy and electricity taxation legislation.
The impacts of existing regulations are identified and reform options and recommendations are derived based on an economic and jurisprudential analysis. How these suggestions may help to improve the control effect is examined with special consideration of energy efficiency requirements and the evolving European legal framework.
