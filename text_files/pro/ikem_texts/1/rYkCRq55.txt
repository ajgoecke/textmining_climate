IKEM report “Grünbuch Energieeffizienz”
In order to reduce primary energy consumption across all sectors and to meet the ambitious climate protection goals to which Germany has committed itself, a new and improved legal framework is needed. For this reason, the Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility (IKEM) welcomes the discussion paper “Grünbuch Energieeffizienz” of the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. It is an important step towards a comprehensive and renewable energy supply.
IKEM supports the ministry’s wish to apply the principle of “efficiency first”. In order to minimize the need for further expansions in the wind and solar energy systems, in particular with regard to power grids, land use, public acceptance and resource protection, the use of energy must be designed as efficiently as possible. This principle must apply to all sectors.
The principle “efficiency first”, according to IKEM, comprises the following three targets to ensure the efficient and sustainable use of energy:
1. Energy consumption should be avoided.
2. Energy needs, which can not be avoided, should be generated and consumed efficiently.
3. Unavoidable and energy-inefficient energy consumption should come from renewable energy sources.
In order to reach these goals, the legal framework needs to be amended. The following IKEM report makes suggestions for the necessary changes.
