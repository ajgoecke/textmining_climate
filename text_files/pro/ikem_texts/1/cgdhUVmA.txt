Happy New Year!
The Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility wishes you a Happy New Year!
With the turn of the year, an extremely successful year for IKEM came to an end: In 2016, numerous undertakings were concluded and large national and international projects were acquired. Accordingly, the institute welcomed several new colleagues.
We are proud of our achievements and will continue our efforts with the same commitment in 2017. In addition to our flagships WindNODE, Kopernikus ENavi, Baltic Integrid and Streamline, we are looking forward to numerous other projects and events – including our annual Summer Academy and the IKEM-Jahrestagung (invitation follows). This year, our motivated team will do extensive research and work on new approaches in the fields of energy, mobility and climate protection. We are looking forward to cooperate with various project partners in this venture and hope to support the next steps in the transition towards even more sustainability.
