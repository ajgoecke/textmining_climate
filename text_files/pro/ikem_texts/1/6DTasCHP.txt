In 2014, more than 350,000 households in Germany faced power cuts because of non-payment. To avoid the social hardships of being excluded from the power supply, alternative solutions are urgently needed. In this context, prepaid concepts are discussed as a way to avoid the payment defaults and to offer both customers and energy providers greater securities.
In order to investigate the feasibility of these concepts, IKEM, Becker Büttner Held Consulting AG and the energy law firm Becker Büttner Held developed a study commissioned by the North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry of Environment. It focuses on the management of receivables in four to five basic energy providers (Grundversorgungsunternehmen) and aims to gain insight into the frequency of defaults and the associated costs, the costs associated with irregular and late payments and the potential for cost reduction through prepaid meters.
Judging from the examples of the participating energy providers, the study is designed to determine the extent of receivables management and costs caused by non-payment. It also aims to derive practical insights that are transferable to all energy providers. Furthermore, the possibility to reduce costs in receivables management through the use of prepaid meters is to be demonstrated on the basis of simulative calculations. The scientific findings from this study can serve as a basis for future decision-making regarding the use of prepaid meters as an alternative to power cuts.
