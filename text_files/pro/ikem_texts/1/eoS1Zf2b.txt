A common European transport policy is an important foundation for the creation of the Single European Market. In the railway sector, however, different national systems and regulations remained operational throughout the years. This includes, among other things, operational regulations, licensing requirements for railway technology as well as control, safety and power systems. National regulations prevented the emergence of an integrated European rail system and a loss of importance of rail transport especially in cross-border traffic.
Since the 1990’s European Union has adopted many new directives that are known as the four “European Railway Packages” (2001, 2004, 2007, 2013). These regulations are designed to finally create a Single European Railway Area and to make rail transport more competitive and more attractive.
Project Information
Despite European initiatives, cross-border traffic still faces many obstacles. This is especially true regarding the process associated with obtaining licenses for operating railway vehicles. On behalf of Deutsche Maschinentechnische Gesellschaft (DMG), IKEM develops concepts to simplify and improve this process.
The project Streamline particularly addresses the relevant actors of the rail licensing process (e.g. licensing authorities, Notified Bodies (NoBos), Designated Bodies (Debos), Assessment Bodies (ASBOs), producers …). Expert interviews and a newly developed assessment tool will provide information about impeding actors or processes. This information will ultimately serve as a basis for operators’ contracting decisions or, where appropriate, for regulatory adjustments in the licensing process.
