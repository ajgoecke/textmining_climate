Project Information
The Baden-Württemberg freight transport concept aims to make road (freight) transport more ecological. The aim is to promote freight transport on waterways and rail through an analysis and evaluation of various relevant actors. This evaluation is based on the synthesis of interdisciplinary work results, which will offer the state of Baden-Württemberg practical recommendations for action in order to make goods mobility more sustainable.
IKEM’s role in the project
IKEM analyses options for shifting freight transport to more environmentally friendly transport modes such as rail and waterways.
On the one hand, it will be analysed whether a current weight privilege for trucks in the pre- and post-carriage of goods, which uses trains and ships in the transport chain, is possible. Strict requirements must be met in order for this weight privilege to be used at present. An expansion/relaxation of the requirements and thus of the permissible weight on the road could lead to a reduction in the number of required modes of transport on the road and thus to a reduction in road congestion, but above all to a reduction in environmental pollution.
The possibility of subsidising combined transport operators by means of the legislation on subsidies is also being considered. Targeted operational support for the operators’ companies could create an incentive to make greater use of waterway and rail transport.
