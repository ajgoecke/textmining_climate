Expanding the network of publicly accessible loading points in Berlin
Project information
The main objective of the joint project is to establish charging points for residents who do not have permanent and secure access to private parking spaces with charging facilities. In this context, the sub-project ElMobile-Berlin-AMLAB is intended to find out to what extent e-mobility can be further developed into a real mobility alternative for this user group by establishing streetlamp charging points in Berlin. In addition, the state of Berlin aims to determine the contribution of mobile-metering charging points to a demand-oriented expansion of publicly accessible charging points. The duration of the sub-project is from November 2019 to September 2022.
IKEM’s role in the project
In the ElMobile-Berlin-AMLAB project, the IKEM comparatively analyses the use of the existing “be emobil” charging facilities and the mobile metering charging points set up within the project. The analysis should enable a transport scientific and economic evaluation of the charging infrastructure development. For this purpose, the usage data of the “be emobil” and mobile metering charging stations will be continuously evaluated based on different, predefined usage parameters using statistical and cartographic methods. The different spatial usage patterns of the charging infrastructure can then be used for the target-oriented expansion of the publicly accessible charging infrastructure.
