Today’s charging infrastructure solutions for electric mobility are mostly designed for car owner’s garages or the semi-public spaces (e.g. workplace, car parks). This kind of infrastructure is not feasible for inner city residents and their cars (the so-called “street light parking”) because of high costs for installation and maintenance. Likewise, there are no comprehensive mobility solutions that link all relevant aspects (e.g. infrastructure, parking operations, transport and energy management, invoicing) together.
The main objective of the joint project City2.e is the development of electric mobility concepts for inner city car owners and new solutions for public and semi-public charging infrastructure. For users whose mobility behavior is not confined to a private car, the potential of multi-modal mobility concepts are to be examined. By linking and standardizing accounting, settlement and information in a central mobility platform, usability of these concepts can be simplified. Energy management systems via suitable charging points and load management solutions will also contribute to a smart grid integration of renewable energies. Together with an efficient charging infrastructure and parking management for urban users of electric vehicles, City 2.e contributes to an opening up of important target groups for electromobility.
The findings of City2.e were taken up in a follow-up project.
