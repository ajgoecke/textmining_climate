The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is the financing mechanism of the UNFCCC and one of the main climate finance sources for developing countries. GCF has a strong focus on supporting those countries which are the most vulnerable to climate change and in need for finance. The Fund has already committed $2.2 billion for climate change projects, striving for equal split between mitigation and adaptation, and geographical balance in its funding over time.
Paradigm shift, result-oriented approach and country ownership are at the core of GCF’s activities. Country ownership means that countries take a lead in what priorities and projects should be funded by GCF. For this purpose, countries should nominate a National Designated Authority (NDA) which serves as the main focal point and authority regarding all GCF activities. Countries should also set up country coordination mechanism and ‘no-objection’ procedure, and establish a strategic framework for the engagement with GCF. The challenge for the countries is to make sure that the NDA, the “no-objection” procedure and coordination mechanism work effectively.
IKEM works together with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and national partners on multiple GCF readiness activities in Thailand, Timor-Leste and Georgia. We provide technical expertise and support strengthening of the NDAs, including all capacity building activities necessary for NDA to work effectively – starting from designing the structure of the NDA team, enhancing their understanding of GCF and NDA tasks, designing options for no-objection procedure, and finishing with development of all needed guidelines, tools and communication materials. We also provide guidance and technical support for development of country programmes which serve as a strategic framework for the use of GCF financing and are based on the existing climate change policies and inclusive multi-stakeholder consultation process.
