Currently the storage capacity of electric automobiles only allow for limited operating distances. In order to enable the use of electric mobility in long-distance transportation, innovative ways to provide the necessary power supply are needed. A concept for individual traffic aims to construct charging stations along motorways. The project focused on the development and demonstration of combined DC-AC fast charging stations (“combined charging system”) intended for a nationwide coverage of Germany’s road network.
In this project IKEM contributed by carrying out accompanying research. The jurisprudential study was commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). It included the analysis of the legal framework for the operation of charging stations regarding the fields of law motorways, road traffic and energy. Regarding the facilities adjacent to motorways (Nebenbetriebe), the nested contractual relations between the road administration, concessionaires, oil companies, leaseholders and other parties involved especially need to be taken into consideration. Based on the results of economic research partners, IKEM experts deliberated on the different approaches to pricing, incentives and funding schemes for the installation and operation of fast-charging stations. IKEM also proposed necessary adjustments of the legal and policy framework.
