Die ambitionierten Ziele der Energie- und Klimaschutzpolitik erfordern umfangreiche Investitionen und nachhaltige Veränderungen bei den Anlagestrukturen. Wir erforschen deshalb, wie durch staatliches Handeln ein maximaler Zufluss von Privatinvestitionen im Sinne von Energieeffizienz und Klimaschutz erzielt werden kann.
Das Team Energieeffizienz und Klimafinanzierung untersucht und bewertet die Finanzierungsoptionen für Klimaschutz und Energiewende auf lokaler, nationaler, europäischer und globaler Ebene.
Klimaschutz ist mehr als „shiftig the trillions“. Wir untersuchen, wie Klimafinanzierung effektiv gestaltet werden kann.
Die ambitionierten globalen Ziele der Energie- und Klimaschutzpolitik erfordern ein Umdenken. Jene Ziele sind jedoch nur zu erreichen, wenn umfangreiche Investitionen getätigt und Anlagestrategien an Nachhaltigkeits- und Klimaschutzkriterien ausgerichtet werden. Der öffentliche Haushalt kann diese Herausforderung kaum allein stemmen. Aus diesem Grund legt das IKEM einen Hauptaugenmerk der Forschung auf Instrumente zur Aktivierung privater Beteiligungen um vorhandene Energieeffizienzpotentiale besser auszunutzen. Die Wissenschaftler_innen untersuchen die Struktur von Klimainvestitionen, Finanzierungsschemata und -modelle und erarbeiten Empfehlungen für Politik und Wirtschaft.
Das Team Energieeffizienz und Klimafinanzierung arbeitet eng mit bi- und multilateralen Investoren, Regierungen und internationalen Finanzintermediären (IFIs) zusammen. Durch die weltweite Vernetzung und einen permanenten Wissensaustausch hat sich das IKEM eine umfangreiche Expertise im Bereich Klima- und Energieeffizienzfinanzierung erarbeitet. Dieses Wissen bringt das Institut in seine zahlreichen internationalen Klimaschutzprojekte ein, die von der Europäischen Union über Zentralasien bis hin zu Ländern der Gemeinschaft Unabhängiger Staate (CIS) reichen.
In Deutschland wird ein großer Teil der Energie genutzt, um Wärme zu erzeugen. Aus diesem Grund hat die Wärmewende die gleiche Bedeutsamkeit wie die Energiewende. Eine nachhaltige Wärmeversorgung ist nur durch ein sektorübergreifendes Umdenken zu stemmen.
Das Projekt hat das Ziel, die Energieeffizienz der öffentlichen Beleuchtung zu steigern und damit die dabei anfallenden CO2-Emissionen zu reduzieren. In Zusammenarbeit mit der Universität Greifswald wird das IKEM Finanzierungsmodelle entwickeln und den rechtlichen Rahmen für die dynamische Lichtsteuerung klären.

Furthermore, it intends to improve energy and resource efficiency and reduce energy bills while improving the health, comfort and wellbeing of all Europeans, including those who can least afford the necessary investments. The question is how this goal can be achieved, as renovating the whole existing building stock to a very high level of energy and carbon performance entails high upfront costs. In different European countries, such costs can range from 1.5% to 3.5% of national GDP per year over the next 30 years.
While the initiative is new, the challenge is not: it has been discussed for more than a decade in several countries. Some of these countries have also made their best attempts to address it; these efforts do not appear to have resolved the issue, however, as the challenge remains. Nevertheless, such experiences may offer very valuable lessons on what worked, what did not, and what improvements can be made in the next steps.
One such experience is the financing of energy efficiency in multi-residential buildings in Lithuania over the last two decades, which has been recognised as a best-practice example both domestically and at a European level. The action was launched by the World Bank pilot project in 1996, with later funding provided from the national public budget, followed by even more funding from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and finally by funds from a growing number of private financiers. While the action was designed to help countries meet their greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-reduction commitments, it generated other benefits in the form of jobs, support to small and medium enterprises, higher bank liquidity and a decrease in energy poverty. This process was not without its challenges, however, and some of these persist. This brief discusses these challenges, along with tested solutions and lessons learned, with a focus on energy poverty.},
