The share of diesel fueled vehicles in the German market has been rising for years. Proponents argue that diesel cars contribute to climate protection in road transport because of supposedly more efficient engines they emit less carbon dioxide. For this reason, the use of diesel technology continues to be promoted through tax benefits and regulatory frameworks.
The study carried out by FÖS and IKEM on behalf of the parliamentary group Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, however, shows that the supposed climate advantage no longer exists. The decisive reasons for this development are efficiency improvements of alternative engines and the fact that diesel technology already exploits most of its emission reduction potential. Considering the higher emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants, diesel even has to be considered the most harmful choice of all reviewed technologies.
