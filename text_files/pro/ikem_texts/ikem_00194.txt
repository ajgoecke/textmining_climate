Investment in energy efficiency upgrades of street lighting infrastructure provides high energy savings and reduces carbon dioxide emissions. It is also very cost-effective and has a short payback period. In spite of these advantages, a large share of the infrastructure in many Central European countries requires refurbishment. The lack of investment in this area is often explained as a result of budgetary constraints on infrastructure owners, many of which are municipalities.
Deliverable D.T2.3.1 – ‘Baseline Inventory’ identifies the obstacles to street lighting infrastructure improvement. We survey public and private actors to examine stakeholder knowledge and experience relevant to financing models for energy efficiency upgrades of street lighting.
Deliverable D.T2.3.2 – ‘Analysis of the funding sources’ summarizes the results of research into potential funding sources for the infrastructure upgrades focusing on the countries of Central Europe. It reviews available EU funding and assistance programmes, national public funding sources, multi- and bilateral financial intermediaries and private sources. For each source, it examines objectives, financial instruments, funded activities, beneficiaries and the application process, if applicable.
Deliverable D.T2.3.3 – ‘Best practice guide’ reviews existing financing models, including self-financing, debt-financing, financing by a private contractor, financing by a private contractor, through energy savings, financing by public-private partnerships, financing by utilities, and financing by citizens. For each model, we provide an overview, identify the projects to which it can be applied, specify its advantages and disadvantages, and provide a relevant case study.
Deliverable D.T2.3.4 – ‘Guideline on finding a suitable financing model for public lighting investment’ draws up on a summary of three preceding and offers a decision-making tree for municipalities for selecting a relevant financing model. It also discusses the linkage between available funding sources and financing models.
Implementing public lighting infrastructure is challenging from the legal and political perspectives. Legally speaking, the main challenges for municipalities are related to public procurement and the award of concession contracts of lighting infrastructure. Politically, public lighting infrastructure should meet the targets set out in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which in turn must meet the targets defined by the European Commission in the Energy Efficiency Directive. IKEM analyzes how the project partners dealt with legal issues within the existing political context and provides recommendations for a legally secure installation or upgrade of dynamic lighting solutions.
Deliverable D.T4.2.1 – ‘Comparative Inventory of the political/legal framework’ analyses the political and legal aspects which will frame the installation or upgrade of public lighting infrastructure in each partner country. We collected a comprehensive inventory of relevant hard and soft instruments in each partner country.
Deliverable D.T4.2.2 – ‘Analysis of the political and legal framework and the examples’ analyzes, based on the experience of each project partner, the legal and political aspects of public lighting installation and upgrade. We analyzed the information provided by each one of the partners and elaborated 7 country reports The deliverable consists of one EU-Report and 7 Country reports for each one of the partners (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Slovenia). We conducted a crosscutting analysis of the country reports to identify common legal challenges as well as provide recommendations for a legally secure implementation of street lighting infrastructure. The analysis could be found in the EU-Report.
Deliverable D.T4.2.3 – ‘Strategy to facilitate the integration of dynamic lighting from a legal perspective’ consist of a best-practice guide addressing mainly municipal decision-makers and infrastructure developers. The strategy will provide recommendations for a legally secure implementation of dynamic lighting solutions.
Deliverable D.T4.2.4 – ‘Information events’ are planned as transnational workshops at 3 different locations during 2018 (Czech Republic, Germany, and Italy) where the deliverable D.T4.2.3 will be discussed with key experts and stakeholders in the field, namely: politicians, decision-makers as well as policy and procurement officers on municipal and regional levels.

Past Trainings
20 – 23 February 2017 | Cracow, Poland
To ensure the knowledge exchange with parallel projects, we delivered the training for trainers on financing energy efficiency in public buildings of the countries of Central Europe that was organized with the TOGETHER project under INTERREG Central Europe platform. As a part of the training, we shared our knowledge on how to conduct financing and economic analyses of energy efficiency refurbishment of public buildings, where to obtain finance for these refurbishments, and which financing models to use. In turn, we interviewed the training participants on their knowledge of financing sources, models, and case studies that we fed back to the Dynamic Light project.
Past Events
Vienna, Austria | 25 – 27 June 2018
At the IEPPEC’2018, we will present the summary of evaluation of financing models for energy efficiency upgrades of street lighting. Every two years, IEPPEC gathers around 150 policy makers, programme implementers, evaluators, and researchers interested in evaluation issues related to energy efficiency and low carbon policies and programmes.
- Presentation at the event: Evaluation of financing models for energy-efficiency upgrades of street lighting
- Contribution to Proceedings: Evaluation of financing models for energy-efficiency upgrades of street lighting
Serock, Poland | 13-16 June 2018
The C4E Forum (Central and Eastern European Energy Efficiency Forum) on 13-16 June 2018 in Serock , Poland gathered 200+ participants from ministries, financing intermediaries, energy efficiency practitioners and other experts in Central and Eastern Europe. During three days they shared experience and best practice from the region on design and implementation of energy efficiency policies and actions, in particular financing. Dr. Aleksandra Novikova presented IKEM’s work on financing models for energy efficiency retrofits of public buildings and street lighting with a focus on best practices existing in the region, including new examples of municipal revolving funds and public-private partnerships.
Brussels | 28 February 2018
Deutsche Lichttechnische Gesellschaft e.V. (LiTG) – German Society for Light and Lighting – organized this event to show strategies how to integrate dynamic lighting into EN 13201 in order to harmonize national street lighting standards. It presented innovative pilot solutions and gave advice how to detect the users’ needs. The event was designed for members of European and national standardisation bodies, city representatives, members of the European parliament, manufacturer and provider of public lighting.
Frankfurt am Main, Germany | 21 – 22 March 2018
