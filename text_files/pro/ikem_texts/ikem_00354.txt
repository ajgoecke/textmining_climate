Project Information
A consortium of small and medium-sized enterprises and two research institutes is jointly developing an innovative concept for the supply and operation of heating networks. This concept pursues the following objectives: Utilization of previously unused exergy, use of heat pumps in heating networks, low-loss heating networks with decentralized user-optimized heat pumps for consumers, improved partial load behavior of the heating network due to numerous generators, thermal and electrical energy storage for load curve compensation and peak load damping, recovery of cooling waste heat from users in summer in seasonal storage, regenerative supply of heat pumps and use of peak-shaving resources as well as monitoring and management software for year-round load optimization and proactive network operation.
IKEMâ€™s role in the project
IKEM is responsible for the legal analysis and investigates the legal framework of the heat value creation chain, starting with the input materials for heat generation, through the heat infrastructure to the value-generating factors of the heat product.
