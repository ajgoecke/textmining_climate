More and more people are moving into cities. As a result, housing space is becoming increasingly scarce and negative effects such as increased motorised traffic are becoming pressing. If car spaces in public spaces are reduced, this opens up new possibilities, e.g. for housing, infrastructure for non-motorised transport or as green spaces.
The main objective of the MUV project is to provide local authorities with a guideline for action on how to successfully redesign public spaces in favour of alternative forms of mobility. This includes specific measures for the urban context and a framework for stakeholder involvement in the planning process. To this end, the project selects, analyses and evaluates examples of innovative rededication concepts at national and international level with a special focus on transferability and the impact of rededication and transformation measures on the local economy. Based on these results, in-depth feasibility studies for three model cities will identify opportunities and risks for implementation. A specialist workshop will serve as an exchange and evaluation platform and the final action guide for municipal decision-makers will bring the results together and enable their dissemination.
In MUV, IKEM analyses the legal conditions of the rededication and transformation measures accompanying the above-mentioned work steps.
