Project Information
The mission of CLASP is to “improve the environmental and energy performance of the appliances and related systems we use every day, lessening their impacts on people and the world around us.” CLASP in its work on improving energy efficiency of appliances in different regions, has been using a number of different energy models in order to assess its impact. However, the models and other assessment techniques resulted in a wide range of estimates which was hard to understand and communicate. In addition, more recently CLASP has expanded its activities into the field of “off-grid” appliances, for example highly efficient DC TV sets that allow watching TV with solar home systems. This triggered a discussion about how to measure impact and outcomes of CLASP’s work.
This study provides an assessment of the different methods and practices used by CLASP to estimate its achievements. It uses CLASP’s programme logic and a graphic description for it, to link its activities, objectives, and impacts. Models and methods that CLASP has used to measure its impacts are evaluated which leads to a number of recommendations regarding what results to measure, how to use models, how to expand the models and how to combine monitoring and knowledge management.
