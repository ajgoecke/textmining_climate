To achieve the climate protection targets of the Federal Government, energy savings and the use of renewable energies are crucial. The transport sector will also have an important share in this endeavor as electrically powered transportation through e-trucks and railways will have to increase in the future. As the largest state-owned enterprise, Deutsche Bahn AG uses approximately 11 billion kilowatt hours per year, making it also the largest electricity consumer. Covering this demand with renewable energies entails a large potential for successful sustainability measures.
IKEM participated in a research project named “Analysis and concepts to increase the proportion of renewable energy in railway transportation. Other project partner have been the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology, DB Energie GmbH (DB Netz) and the law firm Becker Büttner Held. The project was funded by the Federal Ministry of Environment and conducted between January and October 2011.
The main objective of the study was to develop concepts for a technically and economically feasible integration of renewable energies into the operator’s grid while also taking into account the complex supply situation and the specific needs of railway operators.
At first, the researchers developed concepts to increase the proportion of renewable energy in railway transportation and presented the legal framework for implementation. This was the basis for suggestions regarding further legislative action in this field. Lastly, the concepts were evaluated in technical and economic terms and based on their potential future effects on the DB network and the power supply within the DB Group.
