Commissioned by the European Climate Foundation (ECF), IKEM and the chancery Becker Büttner Held (BBH) have developed a feasibility study on the conditions of a legal framework for the realization of energy efficiency goals.
“Cheap energy is the one that is not consumed” – a truism often used in energy efficiency. But actually, it is about more than just saving energy: The German federal government has launched a series of actions in order to promote “the second pillar of the ‘Energiewende’ (energy transition) with the national action plan for energy efficiency (NAPE). Among experts it is actively discussed if these actions are sufficient to meet saving goals or if a coherent and binding legislation is required.
The study by BBH and IKEM investigates these exact questions: How to define a legal framework in order for a coherent efficiency policy to unfold its full potential? Are success criteria such as obligation of goals or independent financing sufficiently established in already existing laws? In this context, how is it possible for the energy efficiency policy (EnEffG) to be launched and fully effective?
