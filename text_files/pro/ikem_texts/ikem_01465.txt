Sohjoa Baltic is a transnational project addressing driverless vehicles in public transport. Since 2017, IKEM and its partners have examined the legal, economical, administrative and technological requirements for the use of automated vehicles in the Baltic Sea region. The results will be published in a five-volume roadmap.
On the 4 and 5 of June, 2020, in Berlin, MAMBA will present the results of the past three years, while also initiating a discussion about the different aspects of rural mobility across Europe, and discussing innovative solutions and successful mobility ideas.
