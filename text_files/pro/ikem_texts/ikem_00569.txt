Transnational and inter-regional electric mobility in Europe
Project Information
The aim of USER-CHI is to unlock the potential of transnational and inter-regional electromobility in Europe. Therefore, different charging technologies will be integrated to achieve interoperability for users. This process includes for example charging technologies, e-roaming, billing, authentication and reservations of parking slots in front of charging infrastructure. The user will be put at the centre of the project in order to be empowered. Moreover, the synergies between electromobility and smart grids will be fostered to contribute to the European energy transition. The developed technological tools, and business models will be put into practice and demonstrated in five areas: Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain), Rome (Italy), Berlin (Germany), Budapest (Hungary), and Turku (Finland). Besides, replication cities have been included in each of the TEN-T corridors involved in the project: Murcia (Spain) in Mediterranean corridor and Florence (Italy) in Scandinavian-Mediterranean corridor.
IKEM’s role in the project
As a research institute the focus of IKEM is on legal research in USER-CHI supporting and accompanying the pilots. Furthermore, IKEM will contribute to the analysis of the user behavior concerning charging and parking, the best practice models and the development of recommendations for necessary changes in policy and law framework on national and EU levels. As leader of WP11 IKEM will be responsible of data management and ethics requirements of the demonstration sites and all activities conducted in USER-CHI.
