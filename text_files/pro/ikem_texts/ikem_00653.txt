General Information
The IKEM Academy is a world-renowned multidisciplinary forum for highly qualified researchers and professionals who want to learn more, think more, and do more for the global energy transition.
The Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility (IKEM) organises the annual IKEM Academy in close cooperation with the University of Greifswald. The IKEM Academy programme offers engaging seminars led by experts in energy- and climate related fields. Academy participants also enjoy hands-on skill building workshops and tour local renewable energy facilities for a close-up look at the cutting edge technology behind the energy transition. And of course, the Academy provides plenty of opportunities for participants to network with international researchers, professors, students, corporate executives, community leaders, and decision-makers working to develop innovative solutions to today’s climate and energy challenges.
