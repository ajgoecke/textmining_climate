IPCC Expert Meeting in Addis Ababa
IKEM Senior Research Associate Aleksandra Novikova contributed to the Expert Meeting held by the Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Addis Ababa.
Aleksandra Novikova, PhD, was appointed among other invited experts to participate at the Expert Meeting on mitigation, sustainability and climate stabilization scenarios held by the Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Addis Ababa on 26 – 28 April 2017.
The Meeting aimed to address two challenges: the need to assess the linkages between high-level climate stabilization goals and scenarios on the one hand and the practical steps needed in the short- and medium-term to make the realization of these goals possible on the other hand. Addressing these challenges is of crucial importance, as practical steps need to be articulated in ways that are meaningful to stakeholders in government, business and civil society, and help them to formulate their responses to climate change.
The meeting included decisive preparations for the assessment of scenarios in the 6th IPCC Assessment Report (AR6). In particular, it was intended to foster dialogue between different research communities, and to stimulate interdisciplinary research activity that will lead to new literature which can be assessed during the AR6 cycle.
