In QUARREE100, IKEM and partners from industry and science are developing concepts for a sustainable conversion of energy supply in urban districts.
Project Information
Together with the Development Agency for the Heide Region, the Institute for Advanced Energy Systems (AES) of the University of Bremen and other partners, IKEM is working in the QUARREE100 project on the development of innovative energy technologies and the sustainable conversion of the energy supply of a district in the city of Heide in Schleswig-Holstein. In the district Rüsdorfer Kamp an efficient power, heat and fuel supply shall be implemented. The aim is to use renewable energies as efficiently as possible and, in particular, to use of excess wind energy that is lost due to grid bottlenecks and a lack of flexibility in the system.
IKEM’s role in the project
In QUARREE100, IKEM and its project partners Fraunhofer IFAM, Fachhochschule Westküste and Jacobs University Bremen are developing recommendations for a restructuring of the legal and regulatory framework for the realisation of innovative energy concepts and interconnected systems. Furthermore, IKEM participates in the development of business models in the work package “ICT, control mechanisms, business models and coupling of sectors”.
