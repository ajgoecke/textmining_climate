Project Information
The energy generated from waste heat sources, especially in the area of manufacturing companies, holds large energy efficiency potentials. The aim of this study is to determine the waste heat utilisation potential for Baden-Württemberg, to evaluate it by taking into account technical, ecological, economic and legal aspects and to derive expansion targets, development paths and concrete measures for increased use of the waste heat. The study offers a comprehensive and systematic elaboration of the relevant aspects and enables an interdisciplinary entry into and an overview of waste heat utilisation and can form the basis for a state concept for waste heat utilisation in Baden-Württemberg.
IKEM’s role in theproject
In addition to project management, the tasks of IKEM include scientific analysis of the waste heat-related legal framework and the development of concrete proposals for policy measures.
