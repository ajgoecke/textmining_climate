Our newest project: WindNODE
IKEM has aquired the WindNODE consortium as a new client. During the next four years the institute will contribute to the project’s sustainable success by analysising the regulatory framework and developing proposals for its amendment.
WindNODE, the showcase for intelligent energy in North-East Germany, wants to promote efficient integration of renewable energy generation, electricity grids and energy users, based on digital interconnection. WindNODE is the showcase in which the German capital region and Northeastern Germany present the technological progress achieved through the energy transition to national and international audiences. Innovative and customer-driven products will be tested in a large-scale real-life laboratory. WindNODE is funded by the SINTEG program of the Federal Ministry of Economy and Energy (BMWi).
The aim of IKEM’s sub project is to identify approaches for an optimized legal framework for innovative renewable energy technologies. It should take into account newly developed economic models, necessary changes in market mechanisms as well as exhibitors’ technical innovations. Therefore, IKEM will undertake an analysis of existing legal barriers.
