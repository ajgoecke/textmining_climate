Energy Law
Transforming our energy system to one powered primarily by renewable energy sources is a major challenge. IKEM supports this process by developing strategies for the continuous improvement of the legal framework. The goal is to promote increased production of renewable energies, facilitate the integration of renewables into all energy sectors, and create opportunities for social participation.
