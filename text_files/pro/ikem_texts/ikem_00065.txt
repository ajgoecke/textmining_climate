New Partnership with UNEP DTU
IKEM and UNEP DTU Partnership signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the collaboration on research and capacity building activities.
In November 2017, the executive representatives of IKEM and the Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency at the UN Environment – the Technical University of Denmark (UNEP DTU) Partnership signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the collaboration on research and capacity building activities promoting energy conservation and energy efficiency. The MoU will become the basis for the two research institutes aiming at joint research activities, the creation of knowledge products, organization of research-related and capacity building events as well as other capacity building activities. The close collaboration between IKEM and UNEP DTU will allow for the creation of synergies in both organisations.
