#IstandwithCEU
IKEM condemns the legislative actions of the Hungarian Government that would threaten the existence of Central European University in Budapest.
In solidarity with Central European University in Budapest, IKEM Director Prof. Dr. Michael Rodi and Senior Research Associate Aleksandra Novikova, Ph.D., submitted letters to the Hungarian government: “The closure of CEU will be a big step back for the country and the region, which have made so many successful steps to overcome the authoritarian regimes dominating them in the last century. […] Therefore, I respectfully call the Government of Hungary to revise its legislation and avoid taking any legislative action that would compromise CEU’s operations and independence. This is a “no go” for the country of the European Union, where democratic values and freedom are the key values.”
More information regarding the latest developments can be found on the CEU website.
