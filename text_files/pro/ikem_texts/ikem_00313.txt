The reduction of pollution in urban areas, caused in large parts by motorized individual traffic, is the overall aim of City2.e 2.0. Through the expansion of electric mobility, increased intermodality and a reduction of the traffic caused by drivers searching for parking space, the project wants to help reduce noise, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in cities.
This model project seeks to simply the search for parking space by installing inexpensive and efficient sensor systems in combination with modern information and communication technologies. Current information about the availability of charging stations and parking lots can be accessed and reserved online by the user (Smart Parking, Virtual Car Park). To improve parking and loading demand forecasts, self-learning models will evaluate individual driving profiles.
To further increase the traffic coordination in cities and conurbations, City2.e 2.0 includes the expansion of existing mobility platforms by adding multimodal services (carsharing, public transport) and SmartRouting. The accompanying research develops business models for intelligent parking management and examines the associated legal control instruments.
