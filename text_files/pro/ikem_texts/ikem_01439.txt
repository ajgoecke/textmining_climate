Bénédicte Martin is a Senior Research Associate at IKEM. She works in projects related to energy law and has been the head of the energy law team since the end of 2020.
She studied law at the Université Montesquieu-Bordeaux IV and specialized in European Law. Subsequently, she worked on German and European energy law at the law firm Becker Büttner Held in Berlin. She has a Master of Laws (LL.M.) from the Humboldt University of Berlin. She completed her legal clerkship at Kammergericht Berlin.
Her focus lies on European and German energy and environmental law. Within the Campfire project, she researches the legal framework conditions of the construction and operation of wind energy-produced ammonia filling stations for shipping. A further focus is the role of green hydrogen in the energy transition.

abstract = {Offshore wind power development is expected to play an important role in meeting the EU climate targets. To integrate offshore wind power, advanced offshore infrastructures such as meshed grids are suggested to optimise the grid development. Meshed offshore grids refer to integrated offshore infrastructure where offshore wind power hubs are interconnected to several countries as opposed to radial connection linking the wind farm to one single country and market. However, development of meshed architectures is hindered by the legal and regulatory barriers.
Earlier research has identified the lack of cooperation and misalignments in national legal and regulatory frameworks as being the main risk factors in integrated offshore network investments. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether a supra-national TSO could facilitate regional cooperation and coordinated investments to develop meshed offshore grids.
Several studies have discussed the case of North Seas, but the Baltic Sea region has had less attention despite the large offshore wind development potential. In this paper, a multi-disciplinary approach combining legal dogmatics and regulatory economics is used to identify the existing barriers and the possible solutions. The Baltic Sea countries are used as illustration. We suggest legal and regulatory recommendations that comply with the EU energy policy targets of sustainability, competition and reliability.},
