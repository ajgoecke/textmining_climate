Biografie
Manfred Greis, born in 1953, worked for more than 37 years in several leading positions for the internationally active heating technology manufacturer Viessmann, most recently as chief representative, responsible for corporate communications, strategic association work and political affairs.
In numerous honorary posts, including President of the Federal Association of the German Heating Industry (BDH) and as a member of the Executive Council of the Association of the European Heating Industry (EHI), he has been committed for many years to the successful implementation of the energy transition in the heating market with due consideration for all three pillars of sustainability.
At the end of 2018, Greis retired from the Viessmann company and from the executive boards of industry associations, and is now active as a freelance consultant. In addition to his membership of the strategic and scientific advisory board of the IKEM, he continues to be involved on a voluntary basis as a member of the DIHK’s environment and energy committee.
With the new IKEM-Forum Wärmwende, the Institute is expanding its focus on the heating market, which plays a decisive role in the success of the energy transition due to the immense greenhouse gas reduction potential of existing buildings. The forum has the great opportunity to become an exclusive platform for the exchange between the heating industry, science, politics and administration and to significantly support the transformation process towards a climate-neutral heating supply. I would like to contribute a little to the success of this important project by contributing my experience and my network.
