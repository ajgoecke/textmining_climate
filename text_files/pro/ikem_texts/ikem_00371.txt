Project information
Together with its partners BBH, BBHC and eM-PRO, IKEM is developing an electric mobility concept for the city of Frankfurt (Oder). The concept aims to be as comprehensive as possible and will include bus traffic of the city transport company, official vehicles of the city administration and municipal utilities as well as commercial and private vehicles. This also includes the potential for electrifying car-sharing services and commuter traffic in Frankfurt. The charging infrastructure requirements for this demand will be analyzed in order to design a location and technology concept that can overcome restrictions imposed by the existing electricity grid.
The Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure is funding the development of the electromobility concept with funds from the fund “Nachhaltige Mobilität für die Stadt”.
IKEM’s contribution
IKEM’s work focuses on the determination of electromobility potentials in the private sector as well as on a concept for the expansion and operation of the charging infrastructure on public roads and on private land. An internet-based survey of the member companies of the Handwerkskammer, the regional economic development agency and the IHK Ostbrandenburg will be an essential basis for determining the potential. The location concept will consider the parking potential of public facilities, housing companies and non-discriminatory public parking spaces on private land. IKEM will also develop concept proposals for demonstration projects in close cooperation with the city administration.
