Happy New Year!
The Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility wishes you a Happy New Year!
With the turn of the year, an extremely successful year for IKEM came to an end: In 2017, numerous undertakings were concluded and large national and international projects were acquired. Accordingly, the institute welcomed several new colleagues. Strengthening our international profile was this year’s main goal: The IKEM Sustainable Energy Academy at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Washington D.C. and the recognition of IKEM as a non-governmental organization with special consultative status at the UN Economic and Social Council were two important milestones.
We would like to thank the many people who support us! This enables our research on key issues of a sustainable economy and society as well as our participation in political debates in Berlin, Brussels and Washington. Please support IKEM’s work with a donation.
We are proud of our achievements and will continue our efforts with the same commitment in 2018. In addition to our flagships WindNODE, Kopernikus ENavi, Baltic Integrid, MAMBA, OTS/I-AT and Green Climate Fund, we are looking forward to numerous other projects and events – including our annual Summer Academy (23.-27.07.2018) and the IKEM-Jahrestagung (15.03.2018). This year, our motivated team will do extensive research and work on new approaches in the fields of energy, mobility and climate protection. We are looking forward to cooperate with various project partners in this venture and hope to support the next steps in the transition towards even more sustainability.
