Anika Nicolaas Ponder is team leader Sustainability & innovation at IKEM. She is responsible for the award-winning Infographic Energy Transition Coloring book as well as the IKEM Academy: Energy and Climate, and manages visibility and outreach measures in the context of the WindNODE project. She was also the project manager of the Baltic InteGrid, which investigated the potential of meshed offshore grids in the Baltic Sea, financed by the EU program Interreg Baltic Sea Region.
She studied at the Amsterdam Business School and completed a Masters degree at the Sorbonne, Paris. Her academic career is enhanced by extensive professional experience in international organisations, such as the OSCE-mission in Kosovo and the United Nations. There she worked on the topic of sustainable development amongst other things.
