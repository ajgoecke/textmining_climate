Background
Demographic change and limited public finances endanger the accessibility of services, goods and social life in remote and rural areas of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR), contributing to an ongoing process of peripheralization. In this context, it becomes increasingly difficult for regional and local authorities to ensure individual “people-to-service” mobility (i.e. enabling inhabitants to reach services and public goods) as public transport options are thinned out and services are concentrated in urban centres which are difficult to reach for villagers. At the same time, services which rely on mobility (e.g. home care, delivery services), i.e. “service-to-people” mobility, are becoming difficult to sustain in sparsely populated regions. Furthermore, there are problematic patterns and structures of mobility that aggravate the situation: Mobility is often sector-specific and purpose-oriented (delivery, welfare, public transport etc.), and there is usually no sound concept for coordination of different mobility options, involving both transport operators and service providers.
Project Information
MAMBA aims to address these issues by giving both dimensions, people-to-service and service-to-people mobility, a new perspective through improved integration of mobility structures. To this end, different forms of regional and local “Mobility Centres” (MC) will be created in nine regions throughout the BSR that are all affected by demographic change, austerity and other socio-economic challenges. Based on specific mobility needs in these regions, the MCs will integrate existing mobility options by introducing enhanced management capacities in transport administration, providing digital and non-digital information systems for residents, creating platforms for public and private enterprises to pool transport services and facilitating cooperation between public transport actors and service providers. Selected new mobility solutions (e.g. rural carpooling, fleetsharing or mobility as a service (MaaS) will be initiated by the MCs as pilot actions.
The transnational MAMBA partnership will exchange knowledge and test and evaluate different operational concepts for MCs which are transferable to other regions. These will be promoted to public authorities, transport and service providers through a publicly accessible knowledge database and a “rural mobility compendium”. As the involvement and commitment of residents is paramount for the sustainable success of innovative mobility solutions, MAMBA partners will monitor the acceptance of services provided or facilitated by the MCs. Furthermore, MAMBA aims to promote residents’ participation in rural mobility design and to strengthen civil society by compiling a “manual for self-organized mobility” directed at grass-roots mobility initiatives throughout the BSR. The findings regarding legal, economic and sociocultural barriers are also pointed out to policy-makers at the regional and national level with a guidance document.

IKEM’s role in MAMBA
IKEM was a leading partner during the application process (2016-2017) of MAMBA. In the actual project, for which funding was granted in May 2017, IKEM’s task is to analyse the legal framework for the operation of innovative rural mobility solutions and Mobility Centres (MC) in the BSR. Existing regulations demand certain requirements for operators of mobility services and determine how public transport must be organised to distinguish it from privately operated mobility services (e.g. taxis). In addition, the national and regional legal framework regarding public transportation differs greatly between Member States within the BSR. Even though there have been legal changes in some Member States that allow for a further flexibilisation of public transport, not all possible rural mobility solutions (e.g. sharing of trips between service providers and private passengers, mobility as a service models) are legally feasible in each country. IKEM will aggregate the results of its own analysis as well as the findings of the project partners/local law experts in the respective member states in a pre-study with transnational scope. Together with the economic and socio-cultural pre-studies, it will serve as a guideline for the operation of MCs.
The experiences made by Project Partners, Associated Partners and other stakeholders as well as potential changes in the legal framework will be used to systematically update the pre-study findings after the pilot phase. This approach will not only allow to avoid legal traps when implementing new mobility solutions and MCs, but also serves as a basis for the overall sustainability of the project: The updated pre-study will, in the final stage of the project, also contribute to the composition of the project’s main outputs, namely the Knowledge Database, the Manual for Self-Organized Mobility, the Guidance Document for Future Mobility Policies the and Rural Mobility Compendium.
